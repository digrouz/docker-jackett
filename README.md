# docker-jackett
Installs Jackett into a Linux Container


![jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett/blob/master/src/Jackett/Content/jacket_medium.png)

## Tag
Several tag are available:
* latest: see alpine
* centos7: [Dokerfile_centos7](https://github.com/digrouz/docker-jackett/blob/master/Dockerfile_centos7)
* alpine: [Dockerfile_alpine](https://github.com/digrouz/docker-jackett/blob/master/Dockerfile_alpine)

## Description

Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.

Developer note: The software implements the Torznab (with nZEDb category numbering) and TorrentPotato APIs.
